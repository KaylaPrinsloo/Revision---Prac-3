            Tulip festivals are held in several cities around the world, mostly in North America, usually in cities with a Dutch heritage such as Albany, New York; Ottawa, Ontario; Gatineau, Quebec; Montreal, Quebec; Holland, Michigan; Lehi, Utah; Orange City, Iowa; Pella, Iowa; Mount Vernon, Washington; and Woodburn, Oregon, and in other countries such as New Zealand, Australia,[1] India,[2] and England. The tulips are considered a welcome harbinger of spring, and a tulip festival permits residents to see them at their best advantage. The festivals are also popular tourist attractions. The tulips are displayed throughout the cities. In certain years the peak of tulips does not coincide with the actual festival due to climatic conditions.
            The world's largest tulip festival is held in Ottawa, Canada, with tulips sent by the Netherlands to commemorate the special relationship resulting from Canadian actions during World War II when Canadian forces led the liberation of the Netherlands and hosted the Dutch royal family in exile.[3][4][5]
