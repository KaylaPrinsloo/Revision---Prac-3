[5] This week's assignment focuses on CSS, but in order to style your content, you need content. To this end, create an index.html file and choose a Wikipedia article to use for content. Copy the title and first paragraph (or paragraphs, above the Table of Contents) into your index.html page and then format it with HTML tags so that it looks as close to the original as you can get it. Be sure to include a comment with a link/citation to the source. You need not replicate any of the links.

[2] Create a CSS stylesheet with the name style.css and link to it as an external stylesheet in the source of your document. To do this, insert the below tag into the head of your document:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css">
Notice the similarities to linking the stylesheet and regular links and images.

[10] Our objective is to make our page look a little like Wikipedia. To do this, we will need to write styles that bring the styling a little closer. You should write styles in the style.css file to try to mimic this design.

To do this, it is suggested you start by writing a style that changes the whole document. You could do this for the html element, but it is more common to do this for the body element.

Write a selector per the below snippet that will apply to the entire body element, and then apply some CSS properties to make it look more like Wikipedia.

body {
    // Your properties go here
}
It is recommended that you set the font-face to Arial, the font-size to 16px.

[5] Once you've done this, make some changes to the h1 element styling as well. Consider making it a different colour, weight, or size. You don't need to stick with Wikipedia design too closely.

[5] Now that you've done all of that, make sure that your page looks the way you'd like, create a second page on a related article from Wikipedia, and repeat the process in question 3 for the second page. Then link the same stylesheet as you did before and watch the magic happen. One stylesheet for the whole site makes for consistent design.

[20] Make use of the CSS resources linked on SUNLearn and make your stylesheet more interesting. You can play with alignment, colour, sizes, etc. Consider the principles of good design that you learned about in Socio-Informatics 214. Add at least two additional rules (selector, property sets), so that there are at least four in total. Make sure, across all your rules, that you set at least 10 properties.

[3] Do you need to be reminded to Save, Add, Commit, Push?
